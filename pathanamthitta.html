    <p>With woods wrapped in mystery, idly flowing dreamy streams, captivating waterfalls and an exuberant wilderness, Perunthenaruvi is a lesser known gem waiting to get discovered! 

        Situated in the forest region of Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta district, one of the major pilgrim centres of South India, Perunthenaruvi allures tourists with its breathtakingly beautiful waterfalls and the dazzling stream that flows to merge with the sacred Pamba River. The locality is the home turf of beehives which have bestowed the place with the title Perunthenaruvi meaning the “River of Honey”. 
        
        There is no better place to have a pleasant peaceful time than when you are romancing with nature and surround yourself with its purity to cleanse your soul. Perunthenaruvi offers you just that.
        
        You can either choose a 5-minute walk or a 20-minute trek through the tea plantations to reach the waterfalls here. The music of the cascades welcomes you even from afar. The hike leads you to a luxuriant waterfall with a luscious swimming hole that tempts one to leap into its deep waters. The stream gushes further beyond through the rocky bed to unite with the holy Pamba. The river Pamba is attributed with divine grace because of its connection with Kerala’s largest pilgrim center Sabarimala. 
        
        Located on the lap of the majestic Western Ghats, Perunthenaruvi adorns herself with her ever gorgeous waterfalls and the mystic lush forest glides that wrap her in their serene arms.  Kudamurutty and Vechoochira are the two shores of the waterfall. 
        
        There are two waterfalls at Perunthenaruvi - the 300 feet Panamkudantha and the 200 feet Padivathil – both of these originate from the dense woods of Sabarimala. </p>
