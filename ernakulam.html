    <div class="tem"><h1>St George Forance Church</h1></div>
    <div><img src="images/ernakulam 1.jpg" class="center"></div> 
    <p> The church has a 14-century history. Its perennial well attracted many people, and the church became a pilgrimage site.

        According to historians, Thomas the Apostle (Mar Thoma Sleeha in Malayalam/Syriac) built seven churches. The Edapally church was built during the sixth century, shortly after the construction of the seven churches.
        
        A statue of St. George (Mar Geevarghese Sahada) on horseback, stabbing a serpent under his horse's hooves, is prominent. The church blends religion, magic, myth, folklore and history.[3] Edappally was a hamlet, part of the princely kingdom of Elangalloor.[6] Its Syrian Christian congregation was small,[3] descendants of those who were converted to Christianity by St. Thomas the Apostle (who came to India in 52 AD). The oldest Edappally church was built in 593, and the one-room building is preserved as a storehouse. It was built by families from Paravur who had to travel to the Kottakkavu Mar Thoma Syro-Malabar Church, North Paravur to worship.
        
        The congregation outgrew the old church, and a second church was built in 1080.[2][7] Its main Madaba/altar and fa√ßade were renovated during the 1970s, and a picture of the Virgin Mary was added.[7] The imported-tile floor remains.
